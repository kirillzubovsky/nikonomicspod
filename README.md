# Nikonomics Podcast Website

Nik ([CoFoundersNik on X](https://x.com/CoFoundersNik)) hosts an amazing podcast called **Nikonomics**. Check it out [here](https://www.nikonomicspod.com).

He invested $5k to have the website built, and [Kirill Zubovsky](https://x.com/CoFoundersNik) challenged AI to create one in just 5 minutes for free.

While this iteration isn't as fully featured as the real deal, you can see that with enough prompts, we can get AI to come pretty close!
